Overview
The Pokémon Weather App is a full-stack web application that combines the power of the Pokémon API and the Weather API to deliver a unique user experience. By integrating server-side technologies such as bcrypt, Express.js, CORS, and pg-promise, this application ensures robust security and efficient data handling. Users can input a location, and the app will fetch weather information for that location and display Pokémon types associated with the current weather conditions.
